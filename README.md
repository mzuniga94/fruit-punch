# Fruit Punch
Fruit Punch is a machine learning program that trains on a dataset of fruit images. The program identifies a fruit based on an image using machine learning algorithms. Data visualization based on accuracy of the machine learning model.

# Technical implementation
Language(s):
* Python 3.7+

Libraries:
* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
* sklearn

Framework:
* Keras

Exploratory Analysis / Data Preprocessing:
* We will begin by using a dataset we found. Then, we will convert these images into a CSV format where we will be able to have information to train our model.

Training:
* We will train the model by using Python library sklearn. 

Data Visualization:
* We will visualize the data with matplotlib and test against the accuracy of the model in identifying these images.

Currently, we are still exploring what data structures and machine learning algorithms we will use to implement this project.

# Usage

Currently, we are thinking if we can use Jupyter Notebook to host a web server locally and display run our script from there. Otherwise, we will package the Python files into an executable with PyInstaller.
