# Technical implementation
Language(s):
* Python 3.7+

Libraries:
* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
* sklearn

Framework:
* Keras

Exploratory Analysis / Data Preprocessing:
* We will begin by using a dataset we found. Then, we will convert these images into a CSV format where we will be able to have information to train our model.

Training:
* We will train the model by using Python library sklearn. 

Data Visualization:
* We will visualize the data with matplotlib and test against the accuracy of the model in identifying these images.

We will be using 
Provide a general discussion on the data structures and algorithms that were used to achieve the goals of the project

# Usage

Currently, we are thinking if we can use Jupyter Notebook to host a web server locally and display run our script from there. Otherwise, we will package the Python files into an executable with PyInstaller.
